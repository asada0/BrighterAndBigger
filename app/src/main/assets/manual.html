            "Brighter and Bigger" is a reading glasses tool for people who have difficulty reading fine print and focusing on nearby objects due to presbyopia, eye illness, etc.<br />
            Presbyopia is a normal condition for people over the age of 40, which arises from age-related changes in the anatomy of the eye. Moreover, it becomes difficult to read small letters due to eye illnesses, such as cataracts and low vision.<br />
            This application helps you to read small letters comfortably by making the images bigger, brighter and clearer with scientific color changing methods.

                            For example, in the case that one color is specified (Monochrome), such as "Light Blue", colors which have the same chromaticity as "Light Blue" are displayed.
                            In the case that two colors are specified (Duochrome), such as "Yellow and Blue", a color which has the same chromaticity as Yellow is displayed when the Lightness value is at its highest, and a color which has same chromaticity as Blue is displayed when the Lightness value is at its lowest (dark). A color's chromaticity is determined by the linear interpolation between light and dark according to its own Lightness.<br />
                            In addition, "Color(s) Used" can be shifted to the next color(s) by tapping the screen with 2 fingers when the "Shift by double-tapping w/ 2 fingers" is ON. (default: Achromatic)<br />
