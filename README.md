## What is the "Brighter and Bigger"?

- A reading assistance tool for people who have difficulty reading small letters.

- "Brighter and Bigger" is a reading glasses tool for people who have difficulty reading fine print and focusing on nearby objects due to presbyopia, eye illness, etc.
- Presbyopia is a normal condition for people over the age of 40, which arises from age-related changes in the anatomy of the eye. Moreover, it becomes difficult to read small letters due to eye illnesses, such as cataracts and low vision.
- This application helps you to read small letters by making the images bigger, brighter and clearer with scientific color changing methods.
